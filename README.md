Cloud Based Admission Process System using Azure Cloud

Our proposed system will be able to benefit the three main crux of admission process system namely: The Admission Board, The individual colleges registered in the centralized admission process and The Candidates.  The different education boards will be able to generate digital mark-sheet with the help of our system and later candidates can use these marksheets to apply for admission process. This can be achieved by education boards stamping their respective digital signatures on the mark-sheets, to be generated for the candidates so that verifying the integrity of these mark-sheets when a candidate uploads the same in the system becomes easier. The need for physical mark-sheet as well the hassle faced by admission board to set up verification centers at various places is thus eliminated. Thus with our project we aim to digitize the admission process which can act as an alternative for the current admission system.
